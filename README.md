# Project- Group 6
Medical Department System -- Web Based

Tracking a patient medical history was a real serious problem to encounter. Since most hospital, don’t keep track of a patient. I decided to come up with a system to keep track of patient information across all the provider’s offices and staff.
In addition, since I am more centered on Egerton University I decide to automate our medical department who use manual system.

# Setting Up the Project

make sure Django is installed in your system
  ( (sudo) pip install django )

Then navigate to the project folder
  cd / .. / ..
  
Then run this command
   python manage.py runserver PortNo
   
   The PortNo is your preferrence maybe 80 or 90 or 50 whichever suits you.
   
Then the project is running.
