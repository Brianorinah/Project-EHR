# Project-EHR
Electronic Health Record System -- Web Based

Tracking a patient medical history was a real serious problem to encounter. Since most hospital, don’t keep track of a patient. I decided to come up with a system to keep track of patient information across all the provider’s offices and staff.
In addition, since I am more centered on Egerton University I decide to automate our medical department who use manual system.
